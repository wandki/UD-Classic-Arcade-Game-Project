## How to play
Hello gamer and welcome to the Classic Arcade Game. 

To play this game, use your keyboard (up, down, left and right) buttons.

Game Rules:
* Try to reach the sea without colliding with ladybugs
* The win strike will record how many time you reached the sea safely
* if you loose, your record will be forgotten and you will start from ZERO :) 

Be aware of the ladybugs... They can surprise you sometimes!
